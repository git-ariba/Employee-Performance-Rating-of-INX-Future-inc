    "    where as the attrition is the lowest in the late 50's age bracket.\n",

    "2. **Employee Job Level v/s Gender**: it is observed that overall Female employees hold a higher job level position than their male counterparts\n",
    " \n",
    "3. **Over Time v/s Work Life Balance**: there is a minute difference seen in the overall work life balance. employees that do not work overtime have a slightly better work life Balance overall.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Performance Rating v/s Training time:** Overall the Average Hourly Rate is the Highest in the Finance Department and lowest in the Data Science Department, however as a whole the average Rate of all departments range between 60 and 70.\n",

    "5. **Attrition v/s NumCompaniesWorked** : shows a clear positive line Graph that showcases that the more the number of companies worked at will also have Attrition.\n",

    "7. **CurrentRoleExp v/s YearsSinceLastPromotion** bar graph shows a positive Relationship i.e. as the number of years in the current role increases, the years since last promoted also increases.  \n",

    "8. Relation Between **Environment Satisfaction and Years worked with Current Manager** depicts that, as the years with the current manager increases, on a overall their Environment Satisfaction reach two opposit extreams i.e. very high or very low satisfaction. in contrary the fewer years with the current manager shows a medium to high satisfaction. \n",

    "9. The Research and Development department and sales department employees have the highest overtime work percentage followed by Human Resources deptartment and Finance\n",

    "11. **Impact of Total work experiance on the Hourly Rate**: it is observed that as the total work experiance increases, the hourly rate has bothe extremes of high Rate as well as Low. in contrary the lower the total work experiance is, the more constant and concentrated the hourly rate is 60-70 Rs.\n",

As a recognition for their hard work such incentives can be given.\n",

    "**2.** As per the management, there has been a noticeable increase in service delivery and Client satisfaction levels have come down by 8 percentage points**\n",
    "-  More employees can be recruited as the work load increases and employees have to face overtime specially in the Research and Development and sales Department, this would also lead to an improved  **Work Life Balance** of employees which is also affected in this process.\n",
    "- Youthful Employees of the Age 18-20 and senior most employees with expertise and experiance can be hired further on as they display higher performance. In contrary those Age groups in between with lower ratings can be given Training, Feedbacks, Replanishment activities/breaks after a heavy work load. when the employees serve with knowledge and expertise the customers satisfaction levels will rise.\n",
